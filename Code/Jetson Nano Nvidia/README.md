# Integration Guide for Finger Counting Project

## Loading the Jupyter Notebook on Jetson Nano
To initiate the finger counting system, you'll need to start by loading the provided Jupyter Notebook on your Jetson Nano. This notebook contains the necessary code to interface with the pretrained AI model and process the image data in real-time.

Follow these steps to load the notebook:
1. Power on your Jetson Nano and open the terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:

`sudo docker run --runtime nvidia -it --rm --network host --volume ~/nvdli-data:/nvdli-nano/data --volume ~/notebooks:/nvdli-nano/notebooks --device /dev/video0 --device /dev/gpiochip0 --privileged nvcr.io/nvidia/dli/dli-nano-ai:v2.0.2-r32.7.1`

4. Open your web browser and enter the URL provided by the Jupyter server to access the notebook.

## Loading the Pretrained AI Model
Once the Jupyter Notebook is up and running, you'll need to load the pretrained AI model `V3.pth` to perform the finger counting. The notebook will have cells dedicated to this taskâ€”ensure you execute them to load the model into memory.

## Uploading Code to Arduino Uno
The next step involves uploading the control code to your Arduino Uno. This code is responsible for receiving the finger count and translating it into a binary representation on the LEDs.

To upload the code:
1. Connect your Arduino Uno to your PC via a USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided Arduino script.
3. Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
4. Click the Upload button to program your Arduino Uno with the script.

## Wiring Schema
A detailed wiring schema is provided in the `wiring` directory. Refer to this schema for connecting the LEDs to your Arduino Uno, and for establishing the I2C communication between the Jetson Nano and Arduino Uno.

Ensure the following connections are made according to the schema:
- Connect SDA and SCL from the Jetson Nano to the corresponding SDA (A4) and SCL (A5) pins on the Arduino Uno.
- Ground connections must be common between both devices.
- If necessary, use pull-up resistors on the SDA and SCL lines, and ensure any required level shifting between 3.3V and 5V logic levels is in place to protect your devices.

After setting up the hardware according to the wiring schema, your system should be ready for a test run. Ensure you follow the instructions closely to avoid any damage to the components due to incorrect wiring or voltage levels.
