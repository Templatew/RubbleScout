# Search & Rescue Robot Project

## Overview

Inspired by the Bujold robot, which was notably deployed in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, this project aims to design and build an autonomous search and rescue robot. The objective is to create a robot capable of navigating complex terrains, identifying obstacles and hazards, and providing real-time data to rescue teams.

## Features

* **Autonomous Navigation** : Utilizes sensors and machine learning algorithms for navigating through unknown terrains.
* **Obstacle Detection** : Equipped with cameras and LIDAR for obstacle avoidance.
* **Communication Interface** : Real-time data transmission to a central control station.
* **Hazard Detection** : Sensors for identifying hazardous materials or conditions.

## Technologies Used

* **Mechanical Design** : CAD Software (e.g., Fusion 36Ã , Oneshape)
* **Electronics** : Arduino and NVIDIA Jetson
* **Software** : Python, C/C++
