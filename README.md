# RubbleScout: *"Navigating Chaos, Saving Lives"*

## Welcome to the Future of Search and Rescue

RubbleScout isn't just a robot; it's a beacon of hope and innovation in the realm of search and rescue missions. Developed as part of our school project in Antibes, RubbleScout is rapidly evolving from a concept to a tangible agent of change in emergency response.

## Project Overview

At this stage, RubbleScout is taking shape both in theory and in practice. Our goal is ambitious yet achievable: to engineer a robot that masters tough terrains, harnesses cutting-edge technology for navigation and safety, and becomes an indispensable asset in rescue missions.

## Core Features

* **Tracked Mobility**: Designed for versatility, our tracked system ensures stability and adaptability across various terrains.
* **3D Modeling and Prototyping**: Leveraging 3D modeling and laser cutting for precision in design and assembly.
* **Sensor Integration**: A sophisticated array of sensors including LIDAR and ultrasonic sensors for real-time obstacle detection and navigation.
* **Autonomous and Manual Control**: Dual-mode operation allowing both autonomous navigation and manual control for complex scenarios.
* **Robust Communication**: Reliable real-time data transmission to facilitate effective control and decision-making.
* **Safety First Design**: Focusing on hazard detection to navigate safely in potentially dangerous environments.
