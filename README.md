# RubbleScout : *"Navigating Chaos, Saving Lives"*
Welcome to the RubbleScout repo! We're on a journey to design a robot that could one day be instrumental in search and rescue missions. While this is part of our school coursework, we believe in the potential of this project. Dive in to see what we've got so far!

## Overview

We're in the design phase of the RubbleScout robot. The goal? To create a robot capable of navigating tough terrains (thanks to its tracked design) and equipped with state-of-the-art sensors to assist in search and rescue missions.

## Features

* **Autonomous Navigation** : Utilizes sensors and machine learning algorithms for navigating through unknown terrains.
* **Obstacle Detection** : Equipped with cameras and LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for obstacle avoidance and 3D scanning.
* **Communication Interface** : Real-time data transmission to a central control station.
* **Hazard Detection** : Sensors for identifying hazardous substances or conditions.

## Literature Review
Before diving into the design, we wanted to stand on the shoulders of giants. That meant going deep into the existing literature, understanding the challenges, and identifying opportunities. Want to know what we found?
