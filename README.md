# Search & Rescue Robot Project

## <span style="color:red">Texte en rouge</span>

Inspired by the [Bujold robot](https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bujold.jpg), which was notably deployed in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, this project aims to design and build an autonomous search and rescue robot. The objective is to create a robot capable of navigating complex terrains, identifying obstacles and hazards, and providing real-time data to rescue teams.

## Features

* **Autonomous Navigation** : Utilizes sensors and machine learning algorithms for navigating through unknown terrains.
* **Obstacle Detection** : Equipped with cameras and LIDAR for obstacle avoidance.
* **Communication Interface** : Real-time data transmission to a central control station.
* **Hazard Detection** : Sensors for identifying hazardous materials or conditions.

## Development Phase

### Operator Control â†’ Automation

Given the complexity of this project, we've opted for an incremental approach to its development. In the initial phase, the robot will be manually controlled by an operator. This allows us to test and refine the basic functionalities while ensuring a high level of control and safety.

As the project progresses, we will integrate sensors and algorithms to gradually replace human control. The goal is to achieve full automation, enabling the robot to operate autonomously.
