# RubbleScout: *"Navigating Chaos, Saving Lives"*

## Welcome to the Future of Search and Rescue

RubbleScout isn't just a robot; it's a beacon of hope and innovation in the realm of search and rescue missions. Developed as part of our school project in Antibes, RubbleScout is rapidly evolving from a concept to a tangible agent of change in emergency response.

## Project Overview

At this stage, RubbleScout is taking shape both in theory and in practice. Our goal is ambitious yet achievable: to engineer a robot that masters tough terrains, harnesses cutting-edge technology for navigation and safety, and becomes an indispensable asset in rescue missions.

## Literature Review and Research Insights

Our journey began with a deep dive into the existing literature, where we explored the nuances of robotic design, particularly in the context of search and rescue operations.
