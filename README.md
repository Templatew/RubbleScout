# RubbleScout: *"Navigating Chaos, Saving Lives"*

## Welcome to the Future of Search and Rescue

RubbleScout is a semi-autonomous robot designed to enhance search and rescue operations in disaster-stricken environments by utilizing advanced detection and navigation technologies.

## Project Overview

At this stage, RubbleScout is taking shape both in theory and in practice. Our goal is ambitious yet achievable: to engineer a robot that masters tough terrains, harnesses cutting-edge technology for navigation and safety, and becomes an indispensable asset in rescue missions.

## Literature Review and Research Insights

Our journey began with a deep dive into the existing literature, where we explored the nuances of robotic design, particularly in the context of search and rescue operations.
