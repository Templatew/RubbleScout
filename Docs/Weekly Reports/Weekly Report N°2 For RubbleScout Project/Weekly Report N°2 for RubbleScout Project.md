# Weekly Report NÂ°2 for RubbleScout Project
School year 2023-2024

## Project Overview
- **Title:** RubbleScout
- **Tagline:** "Navigating Chaos Saving Lives"
- **Student:** Lorenz CAZAUBON
- **Supervisor:** Pascal MASSON
- **Institution:** Ecole Polytechnique Universitaire de Nice Sophia-Antipolis, Robotics Specialty (Autonomous Systems)
- **Location:** 930 route des Colles, 06410 BIOT France

## Session Activities
- **Lamp Circuit Examination:**
  - Detailed review of the circuit powering the lamp. ![Circuit SVG](https://github.com/Templatew/RubbleScout/blob/main/Docs/Weekly%20Reports/Weekly%20Report%20N%C2%B02%20For%20RubbleScout%20Project/Flood-Lamp-Controller-for-RubbleScout.svg)
  - Identified the inability to vary lamp brightness using PWM due to unknown electronic components.
  - Implemented a relay circuit for on/off functionality without variable brightness.

- **PWM and Lidar Progress:**
  - Spent time seeking a solution for PWM, which was unsuccessful.
  - Designed a circuit for controlling the Lidar's movements. ![Circuit SVG](https://github.com/Templatew/RubbleScout/blob/main/Docs/Weekly%20Reports/Weekly%20Report%20N%C2%B02%20For%20RubbleScout%20Project/Lidar%20Mouvement%20Control%20Circuit.svg)

## Plans for Next Session
- Intend to complete 3D drawings of the Lidar motion controller using CAD software.
- Aim to print and test the parts in the next session.
- Anticipate receiving the robot chassis for starting basic mechanics work.
