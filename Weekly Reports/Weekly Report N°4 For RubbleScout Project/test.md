# Weekly Report NÂ°2 for RubbleScout Project
School year 2023-2024

## Project Overview
- **Title:** RubbleScout
- **Tagline:** "Navigating Chaos Saving Lives"
- **Student:** Lorenz CAZAUBON
- **Supervisor:** Pascal MASSON
- **Institution:** Ecole Polytechnique Universitaire de Nice Sophia-Antipolis, Robotics Specialty (Autonomous Systems)
- **Location:** 930 route des Colles, 06410 BIOT France

## Session Highlights
- Examined the circuit powering the lamp in more detail.
- Identified inability to vary lamp brightness using PWM; lack of information on certain electronic components.
- Temporary solution: Using a relay circuit for on/off functionality without variable brightness.
- Encountered challenges with PWM solution; no progress on lidar.
- Designed a circuit to control lidar movements.

## Next Steps
- Plan to complete 3D drawings of lidar motion controller using CAD software.
- Anticipate printing parts in the next session and testing them.
- Hope to receive the robot chassis for starting basic mechanics work.
